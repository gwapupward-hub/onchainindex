# OnChainIndex — Brand Guidelines (v1)

## Brand Role
OnChainIndex is a neutral reference for on-chain usage.
It prioritizes clarity, accuracy, and trust over promotion.

## Voice Principles
- Neutral
- Plainspoken
- Measured
- Data-first

If the copy sounds like it belongs in a research note, it is correct.

## Language to Use
- Ranked by usage
- Based on on-chain activity
- Over the past 7 days
- Increased / decreased
- Calculated daily

## Language to Avoid
- Revolutionary
- Alpha
- Moon
- Game-changing
- Next-gen
- Emojis in product UI

## Visual Identity
- Wordmark-first logo
- Emerald used only as an accent
- No gradients, glow, or animation in v1

## Badges
- “Verified by GwapScore” → dApp profile pages only
- “Ranked on OnChainIndex” → widgets and embeds only

Badges never affect rankings.

## Rule of Thumb
When in doubt, simplify.
