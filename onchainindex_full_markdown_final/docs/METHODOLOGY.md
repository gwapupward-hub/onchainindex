# Methodology

OnChainIndex rankings are calculated using publicly available blockchain data.

## Metrics Used
- Unique active wallets (7-day window)
- Transaction activity (7-day window)
- Growth deltas (Trending rankings only)

## Ranking Calculation
Data is aggregated daily and stored as immutable snapshots.
Historical rankings are never recomputed retroactively.

## Anti-Spam Measures
- Failed transactions are excluded
- Automated activity is reduced using normalization and soft caps
- System programs and test deployments are excluded

## Known Limitations
- On-chain activity does not equal safety or quality
- Some programs may serve multiple applications
- Bot activity is reduced, not eliminated

## What Rankings Are Not
Rankings do not represent endorsements, audits, or investment advice.
